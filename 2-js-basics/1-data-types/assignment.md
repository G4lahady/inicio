Data Types for Shopping Cart
To build a shopping cart, we need to consider various data types that will facilitate the shopping experience. Below, I will discuss six essential data types and explain how they contribute to the functionality of a shopping cart.

Product: The product data type represents the items available for purchase in the online store. It typically includes information such as the product name, description, price, quantity, and any other relevant details. Storing products allows us to display them in the user interface, track inventory, and calculate the total cost of the items in the shopping cart.

User: The user data type represents the individuals who interact with the shopping cart. It includes details like the user's name, email address, shipping address, and payment information. Storing user data allows for personalization, order tracking, and facilitating the checkout process.

Cart: The cart data type represents the actual shopping cart where users can add or remove products. It may contain information about the products added by the user, such as the product ID, quantity, and any applied discounts. Storing the cart allows users to review and modify their selections before proceeding to checkout.

Order: The order data type represents a completed purchase. It includes information about the products purchased, the user who placed the order, the order date, and the total cost. Storing order data allows for order history, tracking shipments, and generating invoices.

Coupon: The coupon data type represents discounts or promotional offers that users can apply to their cart. It typically includes details like the coupon code, discount percentage or amount, and any restrictions or expiration dates. Storing coupon data enables users to benefit from discounts and allows for validation during the checkout process.

Payment: The payment data type represents the transaction details when a user completes a purchase. It includes information such as the payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.), payment status, transaction ID, and billing information. Storing payment data is crucial for processing payments securely and verifying successful transactions.
