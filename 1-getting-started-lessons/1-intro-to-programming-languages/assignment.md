# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

### Client side tools

#### Safety net tools

These tools make the code you write look a little better by making your development process easier with respect to generating stable and reliable code.

- [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com)
- [JSHint](http://jshint.com)

#### Transformation tools

Tools that transform code in some way, e.g. turning an intermediate language into JavaScript that a browser can understand.

#### Post-development tools

Tools that are useful after you have written your code, such as testing and deployment tools.

##### Testing tools

These generally take the form of a tool that will automatically run tests against your code to make sure it is correct before you go any further (for example, when you attempt to push changes to a GitHub repo).

- [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com)

##### Deployment tools

Deployment systems allow you to get your website published, are available for both static and dynamic sites, and commonly tend to work alongside testing systems.
