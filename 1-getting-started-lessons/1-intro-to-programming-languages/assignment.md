## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

1.) Frontend Framework = React

2.) Backend Framework = Express.js

Meanwhile, a developer will create database, API for significant funtionalities such as Authentication, Post, and Comment. These two parts will be occured in code editor like Visual Studio Code.
